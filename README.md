If you're on Turntable.fm listening to music a lot, but are forgetful or too busy to keep clicking that Thumbs Up button, this script will up vote every song for you! If you don't like a song, just go back to the Turntable.fm room tab and click the Thumbs Down button.  The script will resume up voting on the next song.
            
## Features

* Automatically votes up every song you listen to in your turntable.fm room.
* Allows for song laming and resumes up voting on the next song.
* Awexome is spelled with an X, for eXtremely awexome and don't you question it :P
* Based on Izzmo's AutoAwesomer https://github.com/Izzmo/AutoAwesomer
